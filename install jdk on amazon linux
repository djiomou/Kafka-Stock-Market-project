Step 1: Update the System:

To begin, itâ€™s important to ensure that your Amazon Linux system is up to date. Open a terminal or SSH into your instance and execute the following command:

sudo dnf update -y

This command will update all the installed packages on your system, ensuring you have the latest software versions.
Step 2: Download and Install Java:

Amazon Linux uses OpenJDK, which is an open-source implementation of Java. Execute the following command to install OpenJDK on your system:

sudo dnf install java-17-amazon-corretto-devel

This command will download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.8 on your Amazon Linux instance. Feel free to adjust the version number based on your specific requirements.
Step 3: Verify the Installation:

Once the installation process completes, you can verify that Java is successfully installed by running the following command:

java -version
